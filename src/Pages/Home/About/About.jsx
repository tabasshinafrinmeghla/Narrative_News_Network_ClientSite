The newspaper has an unwritten policy for zero tolerance about gender discrimination and has made encouraging instance in this regard.

        "After observing the status of women employment in the media industry in Bangladesh and learning about women's treatment at different newspaper and electronic media houses, I conceived a very pessimistic idea and was quite disappointed," a woman reporter said, as she was sharing her experience.

        But when she first met the Editor and sought a job in the daily, his words changed her impression and she found it most encouraging, according to her.

        "I've never got any objectionable or rude comments or any sort of maltreatment from any of my male colleagues in The Narrative News Network's," said a woman staff of computer section who has been working with the newspaper for last seven years.

        "During my works, I've never felt that I am of a different gender. You know, I work at ease here," she added.
